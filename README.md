# treadstone
Project Treadstone is a script to do a historic subscriptions import.


There are reference files in [references](./references/). Among them are a csv with the fields that are most likely to be used when importing.
[_local](./_local.py) is the blank settings file.  You will want to copy it to a file named "local.py" and update its values with values specific to you.
